PR Template is inspired by the one used by applyToTheIndustrySim: https://github.com/amonjerro/applyToTheIndustrySim/blob/main/.github/pull_request_template.md

QUICK NOTE:

main branch is for functional builds ONLY

develop is set to the default branch, and will be merged into main when comes time to make a new build

**There should be no branches off of main other than develop.**
